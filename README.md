# colorCGM
Addon to the repo CGM process, to work with 2-color interferograms

main_color.m is the example file. It imports images contained in the data folder.

The Matlab app colorCGMdisplay is meant to render a dual-color OPD-fluorescence image, from two separate OPD and fluorescence images, imported as ascii files.
